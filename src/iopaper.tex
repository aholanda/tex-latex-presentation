We constructed a graph from linux kernel functions relationship and
discovered power law behaviour of outdegree distribution.

\section{Introduction}

In a previous work, we propose a statistical and complex network
approaches to model culinary diversity and evolution in the
relationship between recipes and ingredients of four different cookery
books~\cite{culinary:njp:2008}. In this work, we use the same approach
to model static relationship of functions using an operating system
source code as input data.

\section{Graph construction}

We constructed a $G$ graph with the following convention: 
the functions are the vertices and the arcs come from the callee
function to the caller function as showed in the Figure~\ref{fig:fungraph}.

  \caption{Directed subgraph of functions {\tt resched\_task} and {\tt
      resched\_cpu} of the linux kernel scheduler.}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}
The Figure~\ref{fig:outdegree} shows the cumulative distribution of
the outdegree values.
